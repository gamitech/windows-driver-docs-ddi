# IDebugRegisters2::SetValues2 method



## -description
The <b>SetValues2</b> method sets the value of several of the target's <a href="debugger.x86_architecture#registers#registers">registers</a>.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT SetValues2(
  [in]           ULONG        Source,
  [in]           ULONG        Count,
  [in, optional] PULONG       Indices,
  [in]           ULONG        Start,
  [in]           PDEBUG_VALUE Values
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Source [in]

Specifies the register source to query.

The possible values are listed in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Register source</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_REGSRC_DEBUGGEE

</td>
<td>
Fetch register information from the target.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_REGSRC_EXPLICIT

</td>
<td>
Fetch register information from the current explicit <a href="debugger.changing_contexts#register_context#register_context">register context</a>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_REGSRC_FRAME

</td>
<td>
Fetch register information from the current scope's register context.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Stack unwinding does not guarantee accurate updating of the register context, so the scope frame's register context might not be accurate in all cases.</div>
<div> </div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param Count [in]

Specifies the number of registers for which to set the values.


### -param Indices [in, optional]

Specifies an array that contains the indices of the registers for which to set the values.  The number of elements in this array is <i>Count</i>.  If <i>Indices</i> is <b>NULL</b>, <i>Start</i> is used instead.


### -param Start [in]

If <i>Indices</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the registers will be set consecutively starting at this index.  Otherwise, it is ignored.


### -param Values [in]

An array that contains the values to which to set the registers.  The number of elements that this array holds is <i>Count</i>.  See <a href="..\dbgeng\ns-dbgeng-_debug_value.md">DEBUG_VALUE</a> for a description of this parameter type.


## -returns
This list does not contain all the errors that might occur.  For a list of possible errors, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549771">HRESULT Values</a>.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.

 


## -remarks
The engine does its best to cast the values in <i>Values</i> into the type of the registers; this conversion is the same as that performed by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539158">CoerceValue</a>.  If the value is larger than what the register can hold, the least significant bits are dropped.  Floating-point and integer conversions will also be performed if necessary.  

If the return value is not S_OK, some of the registers still might have been set.  

When a subregister is altered, the register that contains it is also altered.

The method <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556883">SetValues</a> performs the same task as this method but always uses the target as the register source.
