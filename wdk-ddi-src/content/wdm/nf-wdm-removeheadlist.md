# RemoveHeadList function



## -description
The <b>RemoveHeadList</b> routine removes an entry from the beginning of a doubly linked list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554296">LIST_ENTRY</a> structures. 



## -syntax

````
PLIST_ENTRY RemoveHeadList(
  _Inout_ PLIST_ENTRY ListHead
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ListHead [in, out]

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554296">LIST_ENTRY</a> structure that serves as the list header.


## -returns
<b>RemoveHeadList</b> returns a pointer to the entry removed from the list. If the list is empty, <b>RemoveHeadList</b> returns <i>ListHead</i>. 


## -remarks
<b>RemoveHeadList</b> removes the first entry from the list by setting <i>ListHead</i>-&gt;<b>Flink</b> to point to the second entry in the list. The routine sets the <b>Blink</b> member of the second entry to <i>ListHead</i>. In the event the list is empty, this is effectively a no-op.

For information about using this routine when implementing a doubly linked list, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563802">Singly and Doubly Linked Lists</a>.

Callers of <b>RemoveHeadList</b> can be running at any IRQL. If <b>RemoveHeadList</b> is called at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL, the storage for <i>ListHead</i> and the list entries must be resident.
